# To Do List App
This repository is a to-do checklist app.
- You can add a task.
- You can check the task off once you have done it by clicking on the task name.
- You can uncheck the task by clicking it again.
- You can sort you to-do checklist app by due date, priority or task name.

This app has been programmed using node, document and element API and some CSS. This is a sprint I did in Northcoders, to familiarise myself to the DOM model and how to manipulate it using the document and element API.
